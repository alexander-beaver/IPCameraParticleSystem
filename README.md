In order to run this code, open processing, go to `Tools -> Add Tool` then click on `Library` and add `OpenCV` and `IPCapture`.


> This code *requires* an IP Camera. If you do not have an IP Camera, you can get [cam2web](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1199725/cam-web-Streaming-camera-to-web-as-MJPEG-stream) to stream your webcam as an MJPEG stream


All missing assets were replaced with a 64x64 image from [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/), so those may need to be changed later.
